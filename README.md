<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Screen Shot](pic.jpeg)

## Background 
A bank strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, I have devised a machine learning solution that uses a variety of customer historic data including telco and transactional information--to predict the clients' repayment abilities.
The main goal of this project is to ensure the clients that are capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.
